A Requirement Specification document, often termed as Software Requirement Specification (SRS), defines and describes in detail the functions, features, and constraints of a software system. It is a comprehensive description of the intended purpose and environment for software and serves as a contract between the developer and the client.

For our hypothetical "LocalEats" restaurant delivery platform, here's a simplified version of what the Requirement Specification document might look like:
