From a design and project management perspective, creating thorough documentation ensures smooth project development, clear communication among stakeholders, and serves as a reference throughout the project lifecycle. Here's a list of essential documents:

### **1. Project Initiation**

- **Project Charter**: This document provides an overview of the project, its objectives, stakeholders, estimated budget, and timeline. It essentially serves as the project's 'North Star.'

- **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identifies all parties involved in the project, their roles, responsibilities, and their influence or interest in the project.

### **2. Requirement Gathering**

- **Requirement Specification**: This is a comprehensive document that details all project requirements, including functional, non-functional, technical, and user requirements.

- **User Stories & Use Cases**: These provide a user-centric perspective of the requirements and are especially important for agile methodologies.

- **User Personas**: Detailed descriptions of the user archetypes the product will serve.

### **3. Design Phase**

- **Wireframes & Mockups**: Visual representations of the user interfaces of the application. They give stakeholders a preliminary view of the product's design.

- **System Architecture Design**: A high-level overview of the software architecture, detailing components, layers, interfaces, and interactions.

- **Database Design**: Describes the structure of the database, including tables, relationships, keys, and other relevant information.

### **4. Project Planning**

- **Project Plan**: Details the tasks, milestones, timelines, resources, and dependencies. Tools like Gantt charts are often used for this.

- **Risk Management Plan**: Identifies potential risks, their impact, likelihood, and strategies to manage or mitigate them.

- **Resource Allocation**: Details on manpower, tools, and other resources and their allocation.

### **5. Development & Testing**

- **Test Plan**: This outlines the testing strategy, objectives, resources, schedule, deliverables, and release criteria.

- **Code Documentation**: Comments in the code and external documentation that explain how the software works.

### **6. Deployment & Maintenance**

- **Deployment Plan**: Details the steps and precautions for deploying the software into production.

- **Maintenance Plan**: Outlines how the product will be maintained, including potential updates, patches, and bug fixes.

### **7. Closure & Evaluation**

- **Project Closure Report**: A retrospective document that reviews project performance, any deviations from the initial plan, lessons learned, and formal closure sign-offs.

- **User Manuals & Training Materials**: Guides and tutorials for end-users and stakeholders to understand and utilize the software effectively.

### **8. Continuous Feedback & Improvement**

- **Feedback Documentation**: Accumulated feedback from users and stakeholders to guide future iterations and improvements.

- **Backlog**: In agile methodologies, this is a list of features, changes, and improvements planned for future sprints or versions.

Remember, the specific documents you'll need can vary based on the project's size, complexity, methodology (Agile vs. Waterfall), and the organization's specific practices. However, these documents serve as a strong foundational checklist for most software projects.
