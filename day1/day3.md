### **Day 1, Part 3: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**

---

#### **Why Kubernetes?**:

- **Introduction to Kubernetes**:
  - Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers.
  - Discuss its origins from Google, which has run production workloads at scale with it, and how it's now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

- **Kubernetes Features and Benefits**:
  - **Automated Rollouts & Rollbacks**: Safe deployment of applications with the ability to roll back if an issue arises.
  - **Service Discovery**: Automatically balances load traffic and tracks the health of pods.
  - **Storage Orchestration**: Automate storage provisioning based on your storage preferences.
  - **Self-Healing**: Reschedules containers when nodes die, replaces and reschedules containers when they fail, kills containers that don’t respond to user-defined health checks.
  - **Automated Bin Packing**: Automatically places containers based on resource requirements and constraints, without sacrificing availability.

#### **Setting Up an AKS Cluster**:

- **What is AKS?**:
  - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Kubernetes on Azure.

- **Provisioning an AKS Cluster**:
  - **Azure Portal & Azure CLI**:
    - Introduction to the user interface of the Azure portal, highlighting relevant sections for AKS.
    - For command-line enthusiasts, introduce the Azure CLI (`az` commands) and its integration with AKS.
  - **Steps to Deploy an AKS Cluster**:
    1. **Resource Groups**: Define and configure Azure resource groups, which allow you to organize related resources.
    2. **AKS Cluster Creation**: Using either the Azure portal or Azure CLI (`az aks create`), guide through the process of setting up an AKS cluster.
    3. **Kubectl Configuration**: Install and configure `kubectl`, the Kubernetes CLI tool. Demonstrate how to set it up to communicate with the AKS cluster using `az aks get-credentials`.
    4. **AKS Basics**: A brief overview of core AKS components - nodes (virtual machines), pods (smallest deployable units in K8s), and services (a way to expose an application).

#### **Cost Management on Azure**:

- **Monitoring and Budgeting**:
  - Introduce the built-in tools in Azure for monitoring the expenditure associated with AKS and other services.
  - Set up budgets, alerts, and recommendations using Azure Cost Management and Billing.

- **Optimizing Costs**:
  - Highlight the importance of right-sizing — ensuring that you're using the correct VM sizes for nodes and not over-provisioning.
  - Discuss AKS's autoscaling capabilities that can automatically adjust the number of nodes as needed, ensuring you're not paying for unused capacity.

By the conclusion of Day 1, Part 3, you'll have gained a foundational understanding of Kubernetes as a platform and its significance in orchestrating high-load microservices. Additionally, with an operational AKS cluster, you're now equipped with the tools and know-how to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications on Azure. The emphasis on cost management ensures that while we aim for performance and scalability, budgetary considerations remain at the forefront.
